## 1. **Pipeline Projects Overview**

### 1.1 **Why Use Pipeline Projects?**
Pipeline projects are ideal for automating and securing CI/CD pipeline code. They allow you to store pipeline definitions in a version control system (SCM) and provide better scalability and flexibility for complex workflows.

### 1.2 **Creating a Simple "Hello World" Pipeline Job**

1. **Create a New Pipeline Job**:
   - Click on **New Item**.
   - Select **Pipeline** and click **OK**.

2. **Configure the Pipeline**:
   - In the job configuration page, scroll to **Pipeline**.
   - You can write the pipeline script directly in the **Script** text area or pull it from SCM.
   
3. **Example: "Hello World" Pipeline Script**:
   You can write a simple "Hello World" pipeline script like this:

   ```groovy
   pipeline {
       agent any

       stages {
           stage('Hello') {
               steps {
                   echo 'Hello World'
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## 2. **Rebuild vs. Replay**

### 2.1 **Rebuild**
- **Rebuild** is used when you want to trigger the same build **without changing the pipeline script** or parameters.
- It simply re-runs the job as it was executed before.

### 2.2 **Replay**
- **Replay** allows you to modify the pipeline code and then **execute the job with those changes**.
- Useful for **troubleshooting**, as you can experiment with different changes without modifying the original code.

## 3. **Using the Snippet Generator in Jenkins Pipeline**

### 3.1 **Overview**
If youâ€™re unfamiliar with how to write pipeline code, the **Snippet Generator** is a useful tool that helps you build pipeline script snippets.

- **Access Snippet Generator**:
  - In your pipeline job configuration, click on **Pipeline Syntax** in the left menu.
  - Choose **Snippet Generator**.

- **How It Works**:
  - Select a step from the list, configure it, and click **Generate Pipeline Script**.
  - The tool generates the necessary pipeline code for the selected step, which you can then copy and paste into your pipeline script.

#### Example: Using `echo` to Print a Message
1. **Select Echo Step**:
   - In the Snippet Generator, go to **Steps** and select **echo: print message**.
   - Enter the message you want to print.
   
2. **Generate the Script**:
   - Click **Generate**.
   - The generated script will look like this:

     ```groovy
     echo 'Your message here'
     ```

- **Copy and Paste the Generated Script** into your pipeline script.

## 4 **Pipeline Execution Mode**

By default, Jenkins pipeline execution occurs **serially**:
- Each stage will run one after another.
- A stage only runs if the previous stage was successful.

If you want to run stages in parallel or control the execution flow differently, you can modify the pipeline script accordingly.
